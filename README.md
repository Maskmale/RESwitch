## Requirements
* Xcode 4.5 or higher

## Demo

Build and run the `RESwitchExample` project in Xcode to see `RESwitch` in action.

## Installation

The recommended approach for installating RESwitch is via the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager, as it provides flexible dependency management and dead simple installation.

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```

Edit your Podfile and add `RESwitch`:

``` bash
$ edit Podfile
platform :ios, '5.0'
pod 'RESwitch', '~> 1.0'
```

Install into your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

Add `#include "RESwitch.h"` to the top of classes that will use it.
